# SPA Router with React + Vite

Welcome to the **SPA Router** project! This repository demonstrates a single-page application (SPA) setup using React and Vite, featuring a minimal configuration for fast development and modern tooling.

## Overview

This project leverages **Vite** as the build tool and **React** as the front-end framework. It includes hot module replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience and integrates essential ESLint rules to maintain code quality.

## Key Features

- **Fast Development**: Powered by Vite's lightning-fast build and HMR.
- **React Integration**: A robust and flexible front-end framework.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Pre-configured linting rules to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- **Plugin Support**: Choose between Babel or SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Plugins

This project supports two official plugins for React:

1. [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
2. [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Recommended Enhancements

For production-grade applications, consider the following:

- **TypeScript Integration**: Add type safety and enable type-aware linting rules.
- **Enhanced ESLint Rules**: Use [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for advanced linting capabilities.

To get started with TypeScript, refer to the [React + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
